 (3) Originally, the assets of the Issue Department
were to consist of not less than two-fifths of gold
coin, gold bullion or sterling securities provided the
amount of gold was not less than Rs. 40 crore in
value. The remaining three-fifths of the assets might
be held in rupee coins, Government of India rupee
securities, eligible bills of exchange and promissory
notes payable in India. Due to the exigencies of the
Second World War and the post-war period, these
provisions were considerably modified. Since 1957,
the Reserve Bank of India is required to maintain
gold and foreign exchange reserves of Rs. 200 crore
(2 billion), of which at least Rs. 115 crore should be
in gold and Rs. 85 crore in the form of Government
Securities. The system as it exists today is known as
the minimum reserve system.

as small and marginal land holdings with the farm

cultivated land. The Law of inheritance leads to
fragmentation of land among the inheritors of land.
Again, desire of land ownership could also be
attributed to the fragmentation of land. Owning of
land is more a social status in India, than an economic
exigency.

 (1) Average Revenue refers to revenue received per
unit of output sold. It is the same as Price of the
commodity. Average revenue can be obtained by di-
viding the total revenue by the number of units sold.

 (2) If the poured liquid is relatively hotter or colder in
comparison to the tumbler, it will break. When hot
water is poured into a tumbler there is an uneven
increase in the thermal expansion of the walls of the
vessel. If the expansion is uneven enough and the
strength of the glass is not strong enough, the tumbler
breaks. However, if the poured water is colder in
comparison to the tumbler, it breaks due to contraction
and unequal temperature difference between the layers.

 (3) The potential energy of a body when raised through
height h is given by mgh. Each time, a normal rubber
ball hits the floor, it loses one-fifth of its total energy
and the rebound height is proportional to energy, so
each bounce will rebound to four-fifth of the previous
bounce. But, the question states that there is no loss
of energy/velocity after rebounding. So the height of
2 metres will be maintained.

 (1) Almost all sunlight that enters the ocean is absorbed,
except very close to the coast. The red, yellow, and
green wavelengths of sunlight are absorbed by water
molecules in the ocean. The reason the ocean is blue
is due to the absorption and scattering of light. The
blue wavelengths of light are scattered, similar to the
scattering of blue light in the sky but absorption is a
much larger factor than scattering for the clear ocean
water. In seawater, absorption is strong in the red
and weak in the blue, thus red light is absorbed quickly
in the ocean leaving blue.

 (1) It happens because of gravity. A key feature of
super maneuvering aircrafts is a high thrust-to-weight
ratio; that is, the comparison of the force produced
by the engines to the aircraft™s weight, which is the
force of gravity on the aircraft. A thrust-to-weight ratio
greater than 1:1 is a critical threshold, as it allows
the aircraft to maintain and even gain velocity in a
nose-up attitude; such a climb is based on sheer
engine power, without any lift provided by the wings
to counter gravity, and has become crucial to aerobatic
maneuvers in the vertical loop.

 (2) In optics, a prism is a transparent optical element
with flat, polished surfaces that refract light. In a
rainbow, raindrops in the air act as tiny prisms. Light
enters the raindrop, reflects off of the side of the
drop and exits. In the process, it is broken into a
spectrum just like it is in a triangular glass prism.

 (3) Capillary action is the result of adhesion and surface
tension. Adhesion of water to the walls of a vessel
will cause an upward force on the liquid at the edges
and result in a meniscus which turns upward. The
surface tension acts to hold the surface intact, so
instead of just the edges moving upward, the whole
liquid surface is dragged upward.

 (2) Lightning is a discharge of electrical energy that
builds up within a storm. The charges develop because
a storm causes air to move around which rubs against
itself to generate electrical charges. Eventually the
charge increases to a point where the electricity can
flow through the air. Once an electric discharge starts
it provides a better path for more electrical flow than
normal air due to ionization which results in a sudden,
large and fast discharge.

 (1) Bernoulli™s principle states that as the speed of a
moving fluid (liquid or gas) increases, the pressure
within the liquid decreases. In the case of a sprayer,
when the plunger is pushed in, the air flows at a high
velocity through a nozzle, creating a region of low
pressure above the metal tube. The higher pressure
of the atmospheric air causes the liquid to rise up to
the metal tube and come out as spray.

 (3) Electricity travels from a place of high voltage to
low voltage, just as water travels from high elevation
to low elevation. A bird, or any living thing, that
touches a wire (where electricity is moving from high
voltage to low voltage) and also touches the ground (a
place with no voltage) creates a path that allows the
electricity to travel through that body and into the
place with no voltage. When electricity travels through
a body in this fashion, electrocution takes place, and
the bird can die.

 (1) An athlete does so to build up forward momentum
so that when he jumps he already has a forward
motion that would be greater than that of a jump made
from standing in one spot. He needs forward
momentum to get a good long jump and the best way
is to have a running start. In this way, he gets
advantage in terms of inertia of motion which is the

 (2) Any object which allows light to pass through it is
known as a transparent object. The colour of any
transparent object is the colour of the light transmitted
by it. A red rose appears red in white light because it
absorbs all colours except red. However, when seen
in green light, it looks black because the red colour
of the rose is absorbed by the green light.

 (1) The movement of air (sometimes called turbulence)
in the atmosphere of Earth causes a series of
refractions which makes the starlight to get slightly
bent as it travels from the distant star through the
atmosphere down to us on the ground. This means
that some of the light reaches us directly and some
gets bent slightly away. To our eyes, this makes the
star seem to twinkle.

echolocation. They make a sound and wait for it to
bounce back to hear it. If they hear it come faster in
a particular area than the rest of the sounds then
they know that something is near.

of the liquid - (d); and (iii) Acceleration due to gravity
In-line. Since in the present question, we can assume
g to be a constant and know that steel and copper
have different densities, the only case in which they
can have similar upthrust will be because of their
volumes.

 (2) The stars™ light must travel through the Earth™s
multi-layered atmosphere, and as it does so it is
refracted (bent) multiple times and in random
directions. The phenomenon of random refraction
appears to make the star wink as though it is in
motion. It is this action that our eyes translate as
twinkling. When the light itself enters the air Œ or
atmosphere Œ it is scattered, with the scattering
depending on the air temperature with warm air
causing less bends and colder air causing more.

 (2) In telecommunications and signal processing,
frequency modulation (FM) conveys information over
a carrier wave by varying its instantaneous frequency.
This contrasts with amplitude modulation, in which
the amplitude of the carrier is varied while its frequency
remains constant. In analogue television, the sound
portion of a broadcast is invariably modulated
separately from the video. Most commonly, the audio
and video are combined at the transmitter before being
presented to the antenna, but in some cases separate
aural and visual antennas can be used.

 (1) In an explosion, an internal impulse acts in order
to propel the parts of a system (often a single object)
into a variety of directions. After the explosion, the
individual parts of the system (that is often a collection
of fragments from the original object) have momentum.
If the vector sum of all individual parts of the system
could be added together to determine the total
momentum after the explosion, then it should be the
same as the total momentum before the explosion. Just
like in collisions, total system momentum is conserved.

 (2) Reflected waves are simply those waves that are
neither transmitted nor absorbed, but are reflected
from the surface of the medium they encounter. The
amount of incident-wave energy that is reflected from
a surface depends on the nature of the surface and
the angle at which the wave strikes the surface. The
amount of wave energy reflected increases as the angle
of incidence increases. The reflection of energy is the
greatest when the wave is nearly parallel to the
reflecting surface.

The smaller the wavelength of the passing light, the
greater is the refractive index observed. As white light
passes through a prism, the violet component, having
the minimum wavelength observes the maximum
refractive index for the prism and, thus, gets deviated
to the maximum extent.

 (3) Pure water is actually an extremely poor conductor,
but saturated salt water is a good conductor. The
saltier the water, the better the conductance. The
reason it conducts electricity is because the NaCl
(sodium chloride) breaks apart into a positively
charged Na
+
 and a negatively charged Chlorine Cl
-
.
When current is applied, it is easily conducted by the
highly charged ions.

 (1) The operation of a rocket illustrates the conservation
of momentum. Just before launching, the momentum
of the rocket is zero. When the rocket is fired, it
forces a jet of hot gases with a high velocity through
the nozzle. The jet of gases acquires a momentum
downwards. Hence, the rocket acquires a momentum
of equal magnitude in opposite direction. Thus the
rocket moves upwards.

 (3) In the boiler of a steam engine, there is a firebox
where coal is shoveled into. The coal is kept burning
at a very high temperature, and is used to heat the
boiler to boil water producing a high pressure steam.
The high-pressure steam expands and exits the boiler
via steam pipes into the steam reservoir, the steam is
then controlled by a slide valve to move into a cylinder
to push the piston. The pressure of the steam energy
pushing the piston turns the drive wheel in a circle,
creating motion for the locomotive.

 (1) The formula of frequency is:
f = c / ë = wave
speed c (m/s) / wavelength ë (m)
, where f: fre-
quency, c: wave speed, and
ë
: wavelength.
As per the question, f = 300/0.3 = 1000 cycles/

Vacuum distillation is a method of distillation whereby
the pressure above the liquid mixture to be distilled
is reduced to less than its vapor pressure (usually
less than atmospheric pressure) causing evaporation
of the most volatile liquid(s) (those with the lowest
boiling points). This distillation method works on the
principle that boiling occurs when the vapor pressure
of a liquid exceeds the ambient pressure. Vacuum
distillation is used with or without heating the mixture.

The book, initially written in Marathi, was penned by
Savarkar in response to celebrations in Britain of the
50th anniversary of the 1857 Indian uprising with
records from India Office archives and the whole
project received support from Indian nationalists in
Britain including the likes of Madame Cama, V.V.S.
Iyer and M.P.T. Acharya, as well as Indian students
who had dared not show their support or sympathy
for India House openly. Published during Savarkar™s
stay in London at the India House, the book was
influenced by histories of the French Revolution and
the American Revolution, as much as it sought to bring
the Indian movement to public attention in Britain as
well as to inspire nationalist revolution in India.

 (3) India has witnessed many changes as a result of
globalisation and liberalisation especially during the
last decade of second millennium. We have less than
1 per cent share of world trade against more than
16% of world population. At the time of indepen-
dence it was higher at about 2% though it was forced
to export more than its imports in order to meet the
unilateral transfers. In 1950, the Indian share in the
total world trade was 1.78%, which came down to
0.6% in 1995. According to the Economic Survey
2002-03 this percentage share of 0.6% continued in
years 1997 and 1998. In 1999 this share has in-
creased to 0.7% which clearly indicates that India
has failed to increase its share in the total world
trade.
